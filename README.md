# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-CNN
This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras for the task of traffic sign recognition. The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset to classify traffic sign images into their respective categories. It includes preprocessing steps such as resizing images and loading data from CSV files. Additionally, techniques like data augmentation, dropout regularization, and batch normalization are explored to improve model performance. The repository also includes Jupyter notebooks demonstrating model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.
